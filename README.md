# Static Image Recognition Model using Tensorflow Keras Object Detection Training Model 

### By Ruhan Shafi

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to create an image recognition model that can successfully identify a person’s biological sex and whether they are a minor or an adult with high accuracy. This will be achieved by creating a dense deep-learning neural network using the Tensorflow Keras Library and training it using the publicly available and open-source All Age Faces Dataset published by Tsinghua University.
